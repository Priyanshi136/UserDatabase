# UserDatabase
Built a multiscreen app, which takes some data from user for either sign in or sign up and then storing it into firebase i.e. our database.
Hence, we are not only storing the data into firebase but also retrieving it from firebase when user click on sign in instead of sign up.
Also, tried to implement some advanced ui/ux.
